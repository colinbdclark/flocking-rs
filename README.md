# Flocking Core (in Rust)

This project is inactive and has been replaced with [Signaletic](https://github.com/continuing-creativity/signaletic), which aims to address the same issues but in written C, which was found to be more amenable to use on embedded hardware.

This project was an early-stage effort to rewrite and redesign the core signal processing layers of [Flocking](https://flockingjs.org) in Rust. The goal is to support instruments that can be deployed without modification across different devices and platforms, with a particular emphasis on the Web and embedded platforms such as Eurorack.

## Goals

* Support deployment on the Web (via Web Assembly), desktop and mobile operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS), specialized audio OS-based environments (Bela), and microcontroller-based systems (Daisy).
* Provide a highly mutable audio graph, so that instruments can be dynamically reconfigured while they are running (on platforms where this is appropriate).
* Provide first-class support for using signal generators in non-audio environments such as video processing tools like [Bubbles](https://github.com/colinbdclark/bubbles).
* Make it easier to compose signal processing algorithms from smaller, self-contained pieces; avoid Flocking's (and SuperCollider's) formal distinction between unit generators and synths.
* Support variable sample block sizes that can be mixed together in the same graph, including single-sample graphs.
* Support cyclical graphs, multiplexing/demultiplexing of signals, and multiple channels
* Serve as a foundation for supporting [open authorial practices](https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/onward-2016/onward-2016.pdf) while offering a very low-level signal graph data representation and API upon which more supportive abstractions can be layered.
* Provide a multiprocess-friendly architecture that will support splitting up an application into two main parts:
   * A realtime audio process that:
        * Allocates no memory
        * Takes no locks
        * Communicates via a lock-free message queue and/or circular buffers
    * A "main" process that implements a [Nexus-style externalization interface and data representation](http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/2059/1/Clark_sdr_2017_preprint.pdf) for:
        * Creating signals
        * Getting signal values/representations
        * Connecting/disconnecting signals or updating their values
        * Deleting signals

## Design and Approach

The design of this project is still in flux, and will more fully emerge as I become more familiar with Rust and the constraints of each of the core environments on which it will run (Web, desktop/mobile, and Daisy, in particular). However, there are a few abstractions that are beginning to crystallize:
* The core library, consisting of _Signals_ (which can be individual signal generators or compositions of them) and the _Evaluator_ (which draws samples from Signals), will be completely platform-agnostic and must be integrated with a particular audio API. It will be usable 1) directly in Rust applications, 2) in Audio Worklets by being compiled to Web Assembly with JavaScript API bindings, 3) within C/C++ applications as a bindgen-wrapped library.
* A set of _Environments_ will be developed, which will provide platform-specific logic for connecting to audio input and output devices, encoding/decoding audio files, and mapping hardware-specifc buses (e.g. GPIO, analog pins, or I2S) to Signals.
